DotNetty is a port of [Netty](https://github.com/netty/netty), asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients.

This version is modified based on [DotNetty](https://github.com/Azure/DotNetty)'s 0.7.2 version and is a customized version for the Unity development platform. It removes some dependent libraries and passes the test under IL2CPP.
